# #100DaysOfCode - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2024

Contributed to an open-source project: https://github.com/sankalp1999/twitter-circle/pull/1

### Day 1: March 11, 2024

Started learning Linux CLI. Not a great start to the day, but I still spent an hour learning. Will finish it by Day 2.

The goal is to complete the basics this week - Linux CLI, HTML, CSS, JS and build a couple (at least one) project along the way

### Day 2: March 12, 2024

Continued with Linux CLI. I learned a tiny bit about shells & basic shell commands.

On my way to learn the basics of shell scripting tomorrow. Should also start with HTML and CSS basics.
