# #100DaysOfCode - Log

### Day 0: March 10, 2024

Contributed to an open-source project: https://github.com/sankalp1999/twitter-circle/pull/1

### Day 1: March 11, 2024

Started learning Linux CLI. Not a great start to the day, but I still spent an hour learning. Will finish it by Day 2.

The goal is to complete the basics this week - Linux CLI, HTML, CSS, JS and build a couple (at least one) project along the way

### Day 2: March 12, 2024

Continued with Linux CLI. I learned a tiny bit about shells & basic shell commands.

On my way to learn the basics of shell scripting tomorrow. Should also start with HTML and CSS basics.

### Day 3: March 13, 2024

Completed Fundamentals of Linux CLI. Today was all about `nano` and Shell Scripting. Discovered `top` and `htop`, and I learnt how to kill a process in Linux.

(deleted vscode to set it up properly, so writing this in nano lol)

### Day 4: March 14, 2024

Yet another slow day. Didn't get to do much. Spent some time setting up & (slightly) customizing vscode. Will spend the rest of the day going through my prev notes.

### Day 5: March 15, 2024

Took up a website gig for a friend a couple of weeks ago. A landing page w/ React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS. Should be completed with the MVP by tomorrow.

### Day 6: March 16, 2024

I didn't do anything today. Watched anime, slept for a couple hours and did some house chores.
This shall be my final rest day for now.
Before I go to sleep, I plan to watch these two videos
(A) [CS50 Seminars 2023 - How To Use Git and GitHub](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cspx7YSvp5Q)
(B) [The Basics of Web3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L57DNTdR7y0)

### Day 7: March 17, 2024

Started picking up pace. Worked a bit on the website I was building for a friend. Should be done with the basic structure (w/ dummy content) in a couple of days.

The current week's focus is on learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript, in-depth if possible and building a couple of projects along the way.

### Day 8: March 18, 2024

Late start to the day. Will spend an hour or two working on the website I'm building.
